Project Title: Classification and Neural Network Models from Scratch

This project involves implementing and evaluating various machine learning classifiers and neural networks from scratch, focusing on both traditional classifiers and deep learning models.

1. Classification Models:

	•	Implemented Models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN).
	•	Evaluation Metrics: Each classifier is evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and F1 score, providing insights into their performance on classification tasks.

2. Neural Networks:

	•	Developed Models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
	•	Key Features:
	•	Implementation of the backpropagation algorithm for training the models.
	•	Use of various optimizers (e.g., SGD, Adam) to enhance model convergence.
	•	Applied regularization techniques (L2 and L1) to prevent overfitting.
	•	Dataset: The models were trained and evaluated on the K-MNIST dataset, comparing their performance to identify strengths and weaknesses of different architectures.

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building and assessing machine learning and deep learning models without relying on external libraries for the core algorithms.
